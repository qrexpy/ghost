# Safety and Legal Considerations

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This page contains critical information about the legal and safety implications of using Ghost. **Read this carefully before using Ghost.**

## üö® Terms of Service Violation

### Discord's Position on Selfbots

**Using Ghost violates Discord's Terms of Service and can result in immediate and permanent account termination.**

Discord's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit:
- Automated interactions with their service
- Using third-party software to enhance functionality
- Circumventing rate limits or other restrictions
- Creating tools that automate user accounts

### Official Discord Statement

> "Selfbots are against our Terms of Service. We understand some users may have legitimate reasons for wanting to automate their accounts, but selfbots can be used to spam, scam, or otherwise harm other users and the Discord platform."

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Implications

### Terms of Service Violations

By using Ghost, you acknowledge that:

1. **You are violating Discord's Terms of Service**
2. **Your account may be terminated without warning**
3. **Discord may take legal action for severe violations**
4. **You may lose access to all Discord services permanently**

### Potential Legal Consequences

While using selfbots isn't typically illegal, certain uses may result in:

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) violations** - In the US, automated access to computer systems may violate federal law
- **Terms of Service lawsuits** - Discord may pursue legal action for significant violations
